# AI Session Log

> Append-only log of AI-assisted work sessions. One entry per meaningful session, newest at the top.

The goal is a quick skim-friendly history so you can answer "what did we do last week?" without digging through git logs or chat transcripts.

## 2026-04-24 — Claude Code (Opus 4.7) — Bootstrap AI workflow docs

- **Agent**: Claude Code (Opus 4.7)
- **Branch**: `chore/ai-workflow-docs`
- **Goal**: Create `/docs/ai-workflow/` as the shared source of truth across AI agents and human developers. Remove the unused Spec Kit setup.
- **Outcome**: Created 7 workflow files (`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `CURRENT_TASK.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, `DECISIONS_LOG.md`, `RULES.md`, `NEXT_STEPS.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md`). Migrated the ratified constitution v1.0.0 into `RULES.md` and extended it with git/commit conventions and an "agents must not do X without asking" list. Deleted `specs/`, `.specify/`, and the `speckit-*` skills under `.claude/skills/`. Added a pointer from `CLAUDE.md` to the new workflow folder.
- **Files touched**: `docs/ai-workflow/*.md` (new), `CLAUDE.md` (small addition), `specs/` (deleted), `.specify/` (deleted), `.claude/skills/speckit-*` (deleted).
- **Follow-ups**: Next task to be picked by the team. `BACKLOG.md` and `NEXT_STEPS.md` are intentionally empty and ready to fill with real work.
